# MM Test

This is an endpoint that allows you to create key values data and recover it from a persistent storage.

## Installation

* Download the repository (https://github.com/pepercussi/mm-test)
* go to the project root folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

* In the root project folder run:
```bash
npm start
```
* After that, Web Socket Server will be running in default port 3030 and API Rest Server in default port 3000. You can change those ports creating a .env file and setting the env vars PORT_WS (For Web Socket) and PORT (For API Rest).

## UI Test
You can play with the endpoint testing it from an user interface. For that, you can use your favorite browser and open the file home.html placed in ./public/home.html
